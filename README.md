# CSC317-Group-Project-Website
Group Project Website - in HTML & CSS

This is a GROUP assignment.   Get the starting repository here:

Your goal is to "code" your website design in HTML and CSS for style and layout.  But no javascript yet, or at least very minimal javascript. 

I do expect to see full navigation working, the home page, all product/resource pages, and other intermediate pages.  

Some things I expect in addition to the site:

**File Organization**:
- Files should be in directories within the **public/** directory.  
- Images should be within their own structure (such as public/images/).
- Product pages should be in their own directory (such as public/products/).

**Meaningful Names**:
- Files, and thus the URL, should have meaningful names to the user.

**Submission**:
- Should be in the assignments GitHub (all files/folders within your **public** directory).
- And a writeup in PDF submitted to Canvas.  The PDF should include your team name, all the members of the teams names, the github userid for the submitted assignment and a description of what you did, problems encountered and how you solved then.  (only one person in the group needs to submit)

When you are ready to submit your assignment, tag that version in your repository with the following command:
```
git tag -a CSS -m "TAG CSSVersion"
git push origin --tags
```
